      <p>Greetings!  My name is Jonathan Gomez and although my background is not entirely in computers, I love coding.  Originally, I went to school for opticianry. I got my degree and passed the Florida state board becoming a licensed optician.  I did that for about 8 years until I decided I was ready for a new challenge.  I resigned from my job and joined the UNC Charlotte full-stack coding bootcamp full time.  The program was intensive but I enjoyed every minute of it.  I genuinely love learning new things and putting my problem solving skills to the test.  That's why programming is such a perfect match for me.  </p>
    <p>I look forward to sharpening my abilities by continuing to self-teach with online courses and hopefully use those abilites in the real world once I land a job.  I know my lack of programming experience is a sore spot for many employers but there are reasons it can actually work to their benefit.  For one, I have worked 8 years in customer service which has taught me patience, teamwork, and excellent communication skills.  Secondly, I know that every company likes things done differently, since I'm something of a blank slate, I won't bring in any old habits that your company would disapprove of.  In conclusion, I'm really excited to begin my career as a developer and would love a chance to further discuss our compatibility at an interview. </p>
